- write #valid_destination_type(starting_position) for each piece type (returns an array of all valid destination cells)
  - Knight: Complete

- write valid_destination?(starting, target)
  - First checks if target is in list of destinations from starting
  - Then checks if there is a piece in the way
  - At some level I'll need to change based on given type
  - If there is player's own piece in target, invalid
  - If there is opponent's piece in target, valid and opp. piece is captured

- consider splitting up Board. Maybe make a BoardManager that does all the valid move calculations?
  - Should probably write tests before doing this
