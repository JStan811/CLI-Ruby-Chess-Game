Potential classes:
  - Player
  - Piece
    - King
    - Queen
    - Rook
    - Bishop
    - Knight
    - Pawn
  - Board
  - Interface
  - Database (for saving)
  - Game/GameMaster/Chess

Class breakdowns:
  - Player
    - Attributes: @name (Player 1 or Player 2 or Black or White, could later be changed to a user's inputted name), @color (Black or White)
    - Methods: None

  - Piece (potentially a super class for the specific pieces, although not sure if needed)
    - King
      - Attributes: @color (Black or White)
      - Methods: #move (1 square in any direction), #castle
    - Pawn
      - Methods: #move, #en_passant, #promotion
    - The rest of the pieces will share the Color attribute and Move method, with Move changing depending on the piece
    - instead of subclasses for each piece type, I could make the piece type an attribute of a Piece class, then let another class handle the movements based on type. Maybe Board or Chess

- Board
  - Attributes: @current_state (some data structure representing the board and all the pieces' current positions)
  - Methods: #update_state (ie move piece), #valid_move? (maybe split into #valid_cell? and #path_blocked?), #check?, #check_mate?, #captures_piece?, #remove_piece_from_play, #display_board

- Interface (should this be a module?)
  - Methods: #solicit_player_action, displayed messages (#introduction_message, etc.), #display_board

- Database (should this be a module?)
  - Methods: #save_game, #load_game

- Chess
  - Attributes: @player1 (or @player_white), @player2 (or @player_black), @board, @state (for loading and saving?)
  - Methods: #play_game, #turn_loop, #single_turn, etc., its methods would likely mostly just call methods from the other classes/modules
