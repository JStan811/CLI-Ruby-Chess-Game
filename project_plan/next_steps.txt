1. continue Chess#player_action_sequence from line 54
  - be sure to keep writing tests as you go!

2.look at project_plan/chess_psuedocode.txt and continue from where you are

3. W/e order for these:
  - I think you can remove the #convert_notation_to_column_index and #convert_notation_to_row_index tests in chess_spec.rb and then move those methods to private b/c eventually a public method is going to call them where they will be tested
  - clean up MoveValidator#validation list methods
  - figure out what to do with pawn movement - how to know account for diagonal jumps? Currently its considered a valid move, but should only be if there is an opp's pawn to capture. Be sure to update tests once you fix this
  - Write tests
  - Finish board design, see last commit for more info
  - can I make symbols bigger?
  - for Interface#solicit_player_action, create some mechanism that allows the player to enter 'help' for instructions about Chess notation

4. at the end use the rubocop command line thing, also read through everything and refactor

Extras
  - Decide player color randomly
  - Add functionality for special moves - Castling, En passant, Promotion
  - Code for standard chess notation: see branch standard_notation
